# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Model (BHEL – NSE)

This repository contains a **machine learning–based stock prediction system** designed to predict the **next 5-minute candle return** for **BHEL (Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited)** listed on the NSE.

The project implements a complete **train → model persistence → live prediction** pipeline using historical minute-level market data and real-time data fetched from Yahoo Finance.

## Model Training (Bhel.py)

The training script performs the following steps:

Loads historical NSE minute-level stock data  
Cleans and converts numeric columns  
Sorts data by timestamp to prevent data leakage  
Engineers the next candle return as the prediction target  
Splits data using a time-based 80/20 train-test split  
Trains a Random Forest regression model  
Evaluates performance using MAE, RMSE, and R² score  
Performs a sanity check on the most recent candle  
Saves the trained model as `bhel_minute_model.pkl`  

Command to train the model:

python Bhel.py

---

## Live Prediction (predict_today.py)

The live prediction script performs real-time inference by:

Loading the saved trained model (`bhel_minute_model.pkl`)  
Fetching live 5-minute market data for BHEL.NS  
Predicting the next candle return and next close price  
Calculating percentage price movement  
Applying sanity and risk filters  
Generating a market bias signal (BUY / SELL / NO TRADE)  

Command to run live prediction:

python predict_today.py

Sample Output:

Last Close               : 268.0  
Predicted Return         : 0.0012  
Predicted Next Close     : 268.32  
Predicted % Move         : 0.1200%  
Previous Candle % Move   : 0.2244%  
Market Bias              : BUY 📈

## Risk Management

Maximum allowed price movement per 5-minute candle is ±1%  
Predictions exceeding this threshold are automatically rejected  
A minimum movement threshold helps prevent over-trading during low volatility
